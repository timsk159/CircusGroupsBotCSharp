# CircusGroupsBotCSharp


## Frameworks
This project makes use of a few frameworks:

 - EntityFramework: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/
 - Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql (MariaDB): https://github.com/PomeloFoundation/Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql
 - Discord.net: https://docs.stillu.cc/guides/introduction/intro.html


## Local development environment

To setup your local development environment, follow these steps:

#### Create a discord bot:
https://docs.stillu.cc/guides/getting_started/first-bot.html

Copy or write down your bots token, you will need it later

#### Install MariaDB:
https://mariadb.com/downloads/
Make sure you install HeidiSQL with the installer, unless you enjoy typing SQL manually.

#### Install Visual Studio:
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/

#### Setup Environment
##### Windows:

 - Clone the project
 - Open cmd.exe
 - Run the following commands:
	 - setx circusBotToken PasteBotTokenHere
	 - setx dbpass ChooseAPasswordHere 
- Open HeidiSQL (installed with MariaDB)
- Create a new database locally, make sure you use the same password as above
- Add your discord bot to a server
- Open the .sln in Visual Studio
- In the package manager console, type: Update-Database
- Run the project in visual studio
- You can try typing "$testcommand" in your discord server to see if the bot is alive and well.

##### Linux:
TODO

##### Mac:

 - Go to store 
 - Buy a different computer
 - See "Windows" or "Linux"


For tims sanity, this is how to update the bot:
  - Make sure environment variables are set:
      - export circusBotToken={BotToken}
      - export dbuser=admin
      - export dbpass={pass}
  - do a git pull
  - dotnet publish CircusGroupsBot
  - dotnet migrate CircusGroupsBot
  - nohup ./CircusGroupsBot &

Now I won't spend an hour re-remembering this twice a year
